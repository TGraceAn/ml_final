# ml_midterm

Lol, sorry for the wrong naming thinging, we'll be using this for our midterm project in 3 days

Using Google Speech Command as our dataset, we want to train so that the model recognise words (just some basic words first)

To download the Google Speech Commands V2 data set run the command:

```bash
bash download_gsc.sh <path/to/dataset/root>
```
